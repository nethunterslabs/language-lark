# language-lark Atom

Lark Grammar syntax highlighting and snippets for the atom editor.

https://atom.io/packages/language-lark

## Description

Originally forked from [Vscode-Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/vscode-lark) to add syntax highlighting and snippets to [Lark Grammar](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) files in Atom.

The grammar files should end with `.lark`.

Contributions are greatly appreciated.

Please fork this repository and open a pull request to make grammar tweaks, add support for other sub-grammars etc.
